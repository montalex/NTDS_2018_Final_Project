# NTDS_2018_Final_Project
Repository hosting the final project of the Network Tour of Data Science's class

In this project, we present an analysis of epidemic spread through flight routes modeled with SIS (Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible). The purpose of this study is to analyse network properties in order to find the best way to slow down a very infectious disease, focusing only on flight transportation and the contamination of people on large distances. We try to use network properties to find the appropriate way to mitigate the development of a widespread disease, without breaking down the network completely.

In this repository is the notebook of the project as well as the HTML version with all visualization loaded.

This project was done by Amaury Combes, Alexis Montavon, Manuel Faysse & Alexandre Daeniker
